# md-convertor
From confluence html export to md (markdown) with limited offline graph support 

There are two ways to connect to original graph sources:
1. use the sources in confluence, and grant everyone in a group with the permission to access these sources (not recommended)
2. Clean up unwanted edit history/version, download the sources along with html pack,

PS: I am personally against to use other platform or tool to duplicate similar experience in confluence. You don't need to suffer and go through all these just to mimic confluence in another tool (Notion,etc). This tool is used to provide clean RAG that can be used in MD form.
HTML form exported from confluence is not bad, it is sufficient for RAG most of the time. But in some cases we might prefer md for ceratin post processing.
